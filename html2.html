          <h3>Violin</h3>
          <p>The violin or the fiddle is one of the four primary stringed instruments
            in the orchestra. The violin is held up under the chin and played with
            one hand controlling the pitch and the other moving the bow.

          <h3>Viola</h3>
          <p>The viola is slightly larger than the violin and lower in pitch. Other
            than the size differences, the viola is played similarly to the violin.

          <p>The cello has the same appearance as the violin and viola but is much
            larger. The cello has a lower pitch than the viola and violin but a higher
            pitch than the bass. The cello is played sitting down held between the legs.

        <div class="text">
          <h3>Bass</h3>
          <p>The bass is the lowest pitched string instrument in the orchestra. Bassists
            often sit on stools in order to reach the fingerboard to play the bass.
            The bass often plays the harmony.
